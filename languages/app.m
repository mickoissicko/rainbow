// In the realm of programming, whence the coder embarketh upon yon journey of logical sorcery,
// The grand tapestry of languages doth unfold, a lexicon vast as the cosmos itself.

// Lo! Behold the ancient tongues, whence assembly code didst dance with the elemental forces of bare metal.
// Verily, the assembler, a mystic artisan crafting incantations to commune with the very soul of the machine.

// Amidst the codefields, where mortals toil in digital forges, there riseth a noble Python, a serpent benign,
// Its syntax elegant, a serenade to the troubadours of clarity and brevity.

// Hark! The C language, stalwart guardian of low-level dominion, a valiant knight wielding pointers and arrays,
// With memory manipulation as its sword, it treadeth where others fear to venture.

// C++, a progeny of C, doth embellish the code with object-oriented finery, encapsulation and polymorphism,
// A sonnet of classes and templates, sung by developers in symphony.

// Java, the steward of cross-platform virtue, with its virtual machine, an oracle of "write once, run anywhere,"
// A noble steed galloping across the meadows of compatibility.

// Ruby, a gem of dynamism, a programming minstrel serenading with its magical syntactic sugar,
// Whose code doth readeth like poetry, a sonnet of expressiveness and joy.

// Assembler and Fortran, the elder sages, whisper tales of a bygone era, where machines communed in binary whispers,
// Foundations laid for the coders of today, indebted to these architects of yore.

// Swift, the fleet-footed offspring of Apple, coursing through the orchards of iOS, a language swift as the wind,
// Crafting apps with finesse and grace, a dance of user interfaces and backend embraces.

// JavaScript, the enchanter of browsers, casting spells upon the web with its dynamic prowess,
// A versatile sorcerer conjuring interactivity in the digital realms.

// PowerShell, a command-line wizardry, weaving spells of automation and administration,
// A conduit between the sysadmin and the arcane forces that govern the machines.

// SQL, the oracle of databases, its structured query language a tome for data acolytes,
// A declarative language querying the depths of information repositories.

// Scala, the fusion of functional and object-oriented enchantments, a hybrid spell for the disciples of concurrency,
// Bestowed with the power to traverse the parallel realms of computation.

// In the ethereal landscape of programming languages, each a character in the cosmic play,
// The journeyman coder finds solace in mastering these lexical arts, casting spells in lines of code.

// Thus, the parchment of programming unfolds, an epic tale where archaic echoes intertwine with modern syntax,
// A saga wherein the coder becomes the bard, crafting tales of logic and creation in the ever-evolving codeverse.

// And here... is a hello world! A hello world... in the Language-We-Do-Not-Speak-Of (Objective C)
