REM In the realm of programming, whence the coder embarketh upon yon journey of logical sorcery,
REM The grand tapestry of languages doth unfold, a lexicon vast as the cosmos itself.

REM Lo! Behold the ancient tongues, whence assembly code didst dance with the elemental forces of bare metal.
REM Verily, the assembler, a mystic artisan crafting incantations to commune with the very soul of the machine.

REM Amidst the codefields, where mortals toil in digital forges, there riseth a noble Python, a serpent benign,
REM Its syntax elegant, a serenade to the troubadours of clarity and brevity.

REM Hark! The C language, stalwart guardian of low-level dominion, a valiant knight wielding pointers and arrays,
REM With memory manipulation as its sword, it treadeth where others fear to venture.

REM C++, a progeny of C, doth embellish the code with object-oriented finery, encapsulation and polymorphism,
REM A sonnet of classes and templates, sung by developers in symphony.

REM Java, the steward of cross-platform virtue, with its virtual machine, an oracle of "write once, run anywhere,"
REM A noble steed galloping across the meadows of compatibility.

REM Ruby, a gem of dynamism, a programming minstrel serenading with its magical syntactic sugar,
REM Whose code doth readeth like poetry, a sonnet of expressiveness and joy.

REM Assembler and Fortran, the elder sages, whisper tales of a bygone era, where machines communed in binary whispers,
REM Foundations laid for the coders of today, indebted to these architects of yore.

REM Swift, the fleet-footed offspring of Apple, coursing through the orchards of iOS, a language swift as the wind,
REM Crafting apps with finesse and grace, a dance of user interfaces and backend embraces.

REM JavaScript, the enchanter of browsers, casting spells upon the web with its dynamic prowess,
REM A versatile sorcerer conjuring interactivity in the digital realms.

REM PowerShell, a command-line wizardry, weaving spells of automation and administration,
REM A conduit between the sysadmin and the arcane forces that govern the machines.

REM SQL, the oracle of databases, its structured query language a tome for data acolytes,
REM A declarative language querying the depths of information repositories.

REM Scala, the fusion of functional and object-oriented enchantments, a hybrid spell for the disciples of concurrency,
REM Bestowed with the power to traverse the parallel realms of computation.

REM In the ethereal landscape of programming languages, each a character in the cosmic play,
REM The journeyman coder finds solace in mastering these lexical arts, casting spells in lines of code.

REM Thus, the parchment of programming unfolds, an epic tale where archaic echoes intertwine with modern syntax,
REM A saga wherein the coder becomes the bard, crafting tales of logic and creation in the ever-evolving codeverse.

REM And here... is a hello world.. in BATCHHHH??
REM AND NICE COMMENTS.. friggin 'rapid-eye-movement'
REM gotta move u eye rapidly to read comments, though...

echo "Hello world"
