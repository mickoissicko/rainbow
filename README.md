# Rainbow!

This repository shows "Hello world" in every single programming language!

See 'Thanks.txt'

# Some information
I couldn't make a single branch with every single language, as Github breaks and marks it as 'other'.

That is why there are multiple branches to show every single language.

# Branches && Fun

The branches are a cool 'statistic', you could say. There are mutliple:

- Functional (a, b...):
    * statistics of all functional programming languages

- Systems (a, b...)
    * statistics of all systems programming languages

- Scripting (a, b...)
    * statistics of all scripting languages

- Shell (a, b...)
    * statistics of all shell-scripting languages
